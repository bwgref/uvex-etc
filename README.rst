Overview
--------

To be updated.

Add a UVEX figure

Add some words describing the ETC here

Put a link to the example notebook


Dependecies
------------

We require at least python 3.6 for this installation as well as the other dependencies
listed in requirements.txt.

To install these via conda, do:

conda install --yes --file requirements.txt

This is mostly synphot, specutils, and astropy.

Installation
------------

Basic pip installation. First initialize your virtual environment:

conda activate MYENV

...then install a dev version:

pip install -e .

This should make uvex importable anywhere.


ETCs and Notebooks
-------------------

Exposure time calculators are found in uvex-etc/notebooks
